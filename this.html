            =>>"this" : keyword refers to an object,
            that object which is executing the current bit of javascript code.

->In other words, every javascript function while executing has a reference to its current execution context,
  called this. Execution context means here is how the function is called.

  Example:1 <========================================================================================>
          
                function bike()
                 {
                   console.log(this.name);
                  }
                 var name = "Ninja";
                 var obj1 = { name: "Pulsar", bike: bike };
                 var obj2 = { name: "Gixxer", bike: bike };

                 bike();           // "Ninja"
                 obj1.bike();      // "Pulsar"
                 obj2.bike();     //Gixxer

         "In These part 'this' act as 
                          =>> Window-Object <<== 
         If you use 'window' instead of these we can directly access name"
<======================================================================================================>

        (1)=>> Default and Implicit binding of “this”

  1==>> If we are in strict mode then the default value of this keyword is undefined otherwise this keyword act as global object,
      it’s called default binding of this keyword. (default is window object in case of browser).

  2==>>when there is an object property which we are calling as a method then that object
       becomes this object or execution context object for that method,
        it is implicit binding of this keyword.
Example:2
            var obj1 = {
              name: "Pulsar",
              bike: function() {
                console.log(this.name);
              }
            }
            var obj2 = { name: "Gixxer", bike: obj1.bike };
            var name = "Ninja";
            var bike = obj1.bike;

            bike();           // "Ninja"
            obj1.bike();      // "Pulsar"
            obj2.bike();      // "Gixxer"

        In the above code snippet, function call bike() is an example of default binding.
        obj1.bike() and obj2.bike() are examples of implicit binding. 
        Here bike function is declared as part of obj1 but regardless of that when we executeobj2.bike(),
        the context of execution is obj2 so obj2.name gets printed.

        It’s important to know how, when and from where the function is called,
        does not matter where function is declared.
<======================================================================================================>

        (2)==>Explicit and Fixed Binding of “this” keyword

               If we use call and apply method with calling function,
               both of those methods take as their first parameter as execution context.
                that is this binding.
 Example:3       <=============================================>

          function bike() {
          console.log(this.name);
             }

      var name = "Ninja";
      var obj = { name: "Pulsar" }

      bike();           // "Ninja"
      bike.call(obj);   // "Pulsar"

In this above snippet, if we call the function bike with call() method passing execution context object obj as first argument,
then obj gets assigned to this object and it prints “Pulsar” which is nothing but obj.name.
It’s called explicit binding of this keyword.

In Fixed binding or Hard binding, we can force the this object to be same always no matter
from where and how it gets called.
Example:4 <=======================================>

   var bike = function() {

       console.log(this.name);

         }
        var name = "Ninja";
        var obj1 = { name: "Pulsar" };
        var obj2 = { name: "Gixxer" };

        var originalBikeFun = bike;
        bike = function() {
          originalBikeFun.call(obj1);
        };

        bike();           // "Pulsar"
        bike.call(obj2);  // "Pulsar"

        As per above code snippet, bike() and bike.call(obj2) both call prints "Pulsar"
        which is nothing butobj1.name means the execution context of the function
        bike is always obj1 and its because of originalBikeFun.call(obj1); 
        These kind of this binding is just another flavor of explicit binding called fixed binding.
<=======================================================================================================>

       (3)==>The “new” keyword in JavaScript

        The new keyword in front of any function turns the function call into constructor call
        and below things occurred when new keyword put in front of function

        A brand new empty object gets created
        new empty object gets linked to prototype property of that function
        same new empty object gets bound as this keyword for execution context of that function call
        if that function does not return anything then it implicit returns this object.
        function bike() {
          var name = "Ninja";
        this.maker = "Kawasaki";
          console.log(this.name + " " + maker);  // undefined Bajaj
        }

        var name = "Pulsar";
        var maker = "Bajaj";

        obj = new bike();
        console.log(obj.maker);                  // "Kawasaki"
        In the above code snippet, bike function is get called with new keyword in front of it.
         So, it creates a new object then that new object gets linked to prototype chain of function bike,
          after that the created new object bound to this object and function returns this object.
           That’s how the returned this object assigned to obj andconsole.log(obj.maker) prints “Kawasaki” .

        In the above code snippet, this.name inside function bike() 
        does not print “Ninja” or “Pulsar” instead it prints undefined
         because the name variable declared inside the function bike() 
         and this.name are totally 2 different things. Same way this.maker and
        maker are different inside function bike() .
         <=================================================>
        ==>Precedence of “this” keyword bindings
         <=================================================>
        => First it checks whether the function is called with new keyword.
        => Second it checks whether the function is called with call or apply method means explicit binding.
        => Third it checks if the function called via context object (implicit binding).
        => Default global object (undefined in case of strict mode).

          function show(){
            return this;
          }
          var showThis=show.bind({});
          console.log(showThis()) // it gives empty object
          console.log(show()) //it gives window object

           }
           // I want to print name in a and b object using showName Function

            }
            var addFun=function(a){
              return this.num + a;
            };

            console.log(addFun.call(obj,3)); // 8
<============================================================================>
         2 ==> Apply for Passing list of datas like array
             var obj={
              num:4

            var addFun=function(a,b,c){
              return this.num + a+b+c;
            };
            
            var arr=[1,2,3];
            console.log(addFun.apply(obj,arr)); // 10
<================================================================================>

              num:4
            }
            var addFun=function(a,b,c){
              return this.num + a+b+c;
            };
            
            var arr=[1,2,3];
            var bound=addFun.bind(obj);
            console.log(bound(1,2,3)); 
 <=========================================================================================================>
                                       PART -2
          The this keyword hands-down is one of the most widely used and yet misunderstood in JavaScript.
          I’ll try to change that today.
          Let’s go back to the good old school days, when we learned about pronouns.

          "Phelps is swimming fast because he wants to win the race."

           Note the use of the pronoun “he”.
           We don’t directly address Phelps here but use the pronoun he to refer to Phelps. 
           Similarly JavaScript uses the this keyword as a referent to refer to the object
           in context i.e the subject.
           <=========================================================================>
           Example:

            var car= {
            make: "Lamborghini",
            model: "Huracán",
            fullName: function () {
            console.log(this.make+" " +this.model);
            console.log(car.make+ " " +car.model);
            }
            }
            car.fullName();

            In the above code, we have an object car which has the properties make,
            model and fullName. The value of fullName is a function which prints the full name of the car
            using 2 different syntaxes:

            Using this => this.make+” “ +this.model the this refers to the object in context
            which is car so this.make is effectively car.make and so is this.model.
            Using dot notation, we can access the properties of objects, car.make & car.model.
            <=======================================================================================>
            It takes different values depending upon the usage
                     
                     =>Inside a method.
                     
                     =>Inside a function.
                     
                     =>Alone.
                     
                     =>In an event.
                     
                     =>call(), and apply().
        <==============================================================================================>
       ==>> Inside a method

          When this is used inside a method, it refers to the owner object.
          Functions defined inside an object are called methods. Let’s take our car example again.

          var car= {
          make: "Lamborghini",
          model: "Huracán",
          fullName: function () {
          console.log(this.make+" " +this.model);
          console.log(car.make+ " " +car.model);
          }
          }
          car.fullName();

          fullName() here is a method. The this inside this method belongs to car.
        <================================================================================================>
      ==>>Inside a function
  
          this inside a function is a bit complicated.
          First thing to understand is that, like all objects have properties,
          likewise functions have properties too.
          Whenever that function is executed, it gets the this property,
          which is a variable with the value of the object that invokes it.
          this is really just a shortcut reference for the “antecedent object” — the invoking object.

          If the function is not invoked by an object then the this inside the function 
          belongs to the global object, which is called window.
          In this case this will refer to the values defined in the global scope.
          Let’s see an example for better understanding:

           var make= "Mclaren";
           var model= "720s"
           function fullName(){ 
           console.log(this.make+ " " + this.model);
           }
           var car = {
               make:"Lamborghini",
               model:"Huracán",
               fullName:function () {
               console.log (this.make + " " + this.model);
               }
           }
               car.fullName(); // Lmborghini Huracán
               window.fullName(); // Mclaren 720S
               fullName(); // Mclaren 720S

           Here make, model and fullName are defined globally, 
           while car object has an implementation of fullName as well.
           When invoked by the car object this referred to the properties defined inside the object.
           On the other hand, the other two function callings are the same 
           and return the globally defined properties.
           <=============================================================================================>
          ==> Alone

           hen used alone not inside any function or object, this refers to the global object.

           var one="first";
           var two="second";
           var three="third"

          console.log(this.two) //second
          The this here refers to the global name property.
          <==============================================================================================>
          ==>>In an event

          Events can be of any type, but for the sake of simplicity and clarity,
          let’s take a click event.
          Whenever a button is clicked and an event is raised,
          it can call another function to do a certain task based on the click. 
          If this is used inside that function, it will refer to the element which raised the event. 
          In the DOM, all the elements are stored as objects. 
          That is why when an event is raised it refers to that element, 
          because that webpage element is actually an object inside the DOM.
Example:
          <button onclick="this.style.display='none'">
             Remove Me!
            </button>
          <===============================================================================================>
